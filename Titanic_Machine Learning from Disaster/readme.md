Titani_Machine Learning from Disaster
Sept 2022 - Dec 2022
 
 Titanic was a passenger liner which sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912 after striking an iceberg. A
 good model which analyzes the critical elements in survival can benefit companies and other institutes in
 many aspects. Shipbuilding companies who enhance their security level based on information given by
 our model would hold a strong lead in local markets, and earn more profits. Insurance companies may
 also have a good reference for their security evaluating insurance policy against all kinds of similar
 accidents. This research would also increase knowledgement to this infamous accident of human history .
 In this project, we are trying to perform the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and using various machine
 learning methods based on the passengers training and testing datasets of Titanic and predict the survival
 rate based on the analysis.
 Since analyzing the relevance of samples in one category and the samples of the survival rate could be
 insufficient to predict the survival model when a similar disaster occurs. Therefore, if time allows, more
 sample data on different categories should be analyzed together to obtain classifiers with more precision.
