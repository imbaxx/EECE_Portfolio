BEV Assessment on “Tesla Model S Plaid (19 inches)” 	
Oct 2024 – Dec 2024

• Verified MPGe performance against EPA-released data among multiple driving cycles, validating manufacturer’s release data.
•	Simulated a traction inverter (3-phase) and Level 2 charger (7.7kW with PFC) in MATLAB/Simulink for OEM battery pack (407V, 100 kWh) with BMS logic under CC-CV profile, included current loop controls simulation on the PFC boost converter.
•	Spearheaded assessments for critical components (IGBT & MOSFET), on evaluating conducting and switching losses. 
•	Integrated inverter and charger designs into process simulations to validate manufacturability and cost-effectiveness.
