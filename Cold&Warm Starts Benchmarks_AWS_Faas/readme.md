Performance Evaluations on Cold/Warm Starts of Serverless Functions (AWS Lambda)
Mar 2025 - Apr 2025

Serverless computing, represented by Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms such 
as AWS Lambda, has become increasingly popular due to its simplicity, elasticity, and cost 
efficiency. However, a significant challenge of serverless computing is the cold start 
latency â€” the delay caused by initializing execution environments when functions are invoked 
after a period of inactivity. This overhead can negatively impact user experience and is difficult 
to predict due to highly variable invocation patterns. In this paper, we present a detailed 
evaluation of cold and warm start performance on AWS Lambda. We build on prior studies that 
have characterized production-scale FaaS workloads, and research that has explored dynamic 
pre-warming strategies, but focus on AWS Lambda as the target platform. Our contributions 
will include measurements across different runtimes and memory configurations, analysis of 
invocation interval impact on cold starts, and suggestions for adaptive resource management 
policies for serverless computing on AWS Lambda.
